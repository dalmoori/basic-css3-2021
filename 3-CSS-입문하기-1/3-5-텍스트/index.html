            O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light, What so proudly we hailed at the
            twilight’s last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous
            fight, O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets’ red
            glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still
            there; O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave O’er the land of the free and the
            home of the brave?
